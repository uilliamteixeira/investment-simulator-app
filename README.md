# 📈 Investment Simulator App

A compound interest investment simulator built with FlutterFlow.

This project was created to combine financial logic, product thinking, and technical implementation into a real, functional mobile application.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this project is simple:
To build a practical financial tool that helps users understand how recurring investments grow over time through compound interest.
It focuses on:
Financial clarity
Logical modeling
Clean UX
Real-world usability

---

## 🧮 Financial Model

The app uses the compound interest formula with:
Initial capital
Recurring monthly contributions
Monthly interest rate
Time (in months)

Formula:
FV = P₀(1 + i)^n + A × ((1 + i)^n − 1) / i

Where:

P₀ = initial investment
A = monthly contribution
i = monthly interest rate
n = number of months
FV = final accumulated value

The results are dynamically calculated and formatted in real time.
